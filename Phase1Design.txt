When the user logs onto the website, I want there to be a super simple interface.

First, the user will see two buttons: buy or sell.
The user will then be sent to the respective page.

First, let's discuss the buyer page.
If the user is a buyer, they will see a list of auction items. Every auction item will have 3 buttons: comment, up-vote, bid.
The commenting and bid options are self-explanatory. The up-vote option, however, will allow users to share their interest in certain items.
If the user clicks "comment" or "bid," a respective window will pop up.
If the user clicks "up-vote," they will get confirmation that the item has been up-voted.
When an auction ends, the winner of the item will be sent an email, confirming their win.
Information about other users, other than the highest bid, will not be shown.
