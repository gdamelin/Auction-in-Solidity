When the user logs onto the website, I want there to be a super simple interface.

First, the user will see two buttons: buy or sell.
The user will then be sent to the respective page.

First, let's discuss the buyer page.
If the user is a buyer, they will see a list of auction items. Every auction item will have 3 buttons: comment, up-vote, bid.
The commenting and bid options are self-explanatory. The up-vote option, however, will allow users to share their interest in certain items.
If the user clicks "comment" or "bid," a respective window will pop up.
If the user clicks "up-vote," they will get confirmation that the item has been up-voted.
When an auction ends, the winner of the item will be sent an email, confirming their win.
Information about other users, other than the highest bid, will not be shown.

Now, let's discuss the seller page.
Two options will greet the user.
One button will say "edit an existing item," and the other will say "sell a new item."
If the user wants to edit an existing item, they will be asked to provide an item id and password.
If the information is correct, the user will be directed to a new window where they can edit the photo, description, minimum price, etc.
If the user wants to sell a new item, they will be directed to a new window where they can upload the photo, description, etc.

Users will not be identified by user ids, user passwords, etc.
Instead, auction items will be the "users," and each item will somehow be linked to the humans.
Whether its through their crypto-wallets or other crypto-addresses, every item will be protected by an item id and password.
