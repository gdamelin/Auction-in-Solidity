Complex task: If the user wants to edit an existing item, they will be asked to provide an item id and password.

We can break this down into several smaller tasks:
1. If the item is editable, notify users of this fact (Event).
2. require item id (Modifier).
3. require password (Modifier).
4. Edit item
5. Note/notify item edit (another Event).

This one thing just got broken down into 5 parts. boom.
