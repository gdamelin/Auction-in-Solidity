1. Website
  A:
    The index page will open to two buttons. Each button will be linked to a sidepage and will load the side page
    when you click on it.
  B:
    The "buyer" page will be a long list of each auction item. Each item will be grabbed from a database of AuctionObjects.
    Each AuctionObject will have these variables:
      minPrice
      currentPrice
      itemImage
      itemDescription
      minBid
      auctionStartTime
      auctionEndTime
      sellerWalletID
      endBuyerWalletID
    The AuctionObject will be expanded upon further in a later section.
    Each AuctionObject will be displayed by picture and item description in a 256px scaled box, adjusted for device size found through metadata.
    The AuctionObjects will be sorted by soonest ending auction.
    When an Auction ends, the AuctionObject is removed from the website.
