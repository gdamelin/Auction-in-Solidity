1. Website
  A:
    The index page will open to two buttons. Each button will be linked to a sidepage and will load the side page
    when you click on it.
  B:
    The "buyer" page will be a long list of each auction item. Each item will be grabbed from a database of AuctionObjects.
    Each AuctionObject will have these variables:
      minPrice
      currentPrice
      itemImage
      itemDescription
      minBid
      auctionStartTime
      auctionEndTime
      sellerWalletID
      endBuyerWalletID
    The AuctionObject will be expanded upon further in a later section.
    Each AuctionObject will be displayed by picture and item description in a 256px scaled box, adjusted for device size found through metadata.
    The AuctionObjects will be sorted by soonest ending auction.
    When an Auction ends, the AuctionObject is removed from the website.
  C:
    The "seller" page requires you to connect your wallet to MetaMask. Each wallet is a Wallet object in 
    
User
  Variables:
    walletID (str)
    currentAuctionsSelling (arr of auctionObjects)
    currentBids (arr of auctionObjects)
   
  Methods:
    Constructor (walletID)
      Behavior: initializes a new User object with a walletID and all other variables empty
    Bid(price, AuctionObject) {
      enters a new bid for the specified price on an AuctionObject
      throws an error if:
        this bid is less than the current highest bid
        this bid is less than the minimum increment bid
        this bid is on an AuctionObject that no longer exists
    createNewAuction (minBid, minBidIncrement, hash, itemImage, itemDescription, auctionStartTime, auctionEndTime) {
      initializes a new auctionObject with the above parameters.
      required fields are minBid, minBidIncrement, hash, auctionStartTime, auctionEndTime
      initialization sends a fee equal to 1% of the minBid price to this wallet address: 0xE2eE05AA87B74AE069F551259f015661981b97ee 
      throws an error if:
        minBid < 0
        minBidIncrement < 10% of minBid
        auctionStartTime < auctionEndTime
        auctionStartTime refers to a block that has already been mined
        auctionEndTime refers to a block that has already been minded
